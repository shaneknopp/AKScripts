# This is a script that makes the map using the GMT commands.
# It writes out to a Postscript file (more on that later).
# To get help with any of the modules. Type "gmt _______" on the command line.
# substituting ______ with the module you want to use. e.g. gmt psxy.
# gmt --show-modules will give you a list of all the available modules
# each module has a massive ammount of options.
# It is good to start with a working script (you can sometimes find some online)
# and then modify it yourself.

# Set up intial parameters. You can change a bunch of defaults here. Like default
# units and size of the map (letter, poster, etc.).

# The output will be a postscript file (.ps). This is a vector file.
# Preview can open it as well as ghostview (gs in terminal). An added bonus
# of is that Adobe Illustrator will be able to open it and you can manipulate it.

#### Set location of files that will be used.
# The XYZ file is a text file wiht lat, lon and elevation for the whole world.
# I usually keep this file somewhere in my laptop and give it the full path to it.
# similar to: set xyzfile=/Users/cristo/Documents/GMTstuff/World.xyz
set xyzfile=World.xyz

# The grd file is the grid file that gets created fromt the xyz. It is a mesh
# that can add more or less detail depending on your needs for the map.
set grdfile=AlaskaMap.grd

# The .cpt is a file that contains the colors that the map will have
set cptfile=AlaskaMap.cpt

# This is the range of Lon and Lat that the whole map will be located on.
set range=-170/-144/50/66

# *** You will see a lot of the lines of code will have the flags -J -R -O -K -V with
# some sort of option appended to it (or not). The -J is the projection type. The -R is
# the range, which specify in the begining of the file. -O sets the Overlay mode, which
# means there was code before this line. -K allows more code to be added to the plot
